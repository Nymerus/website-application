# Welcome on the Web Side of Nymerus

Nymerus team has chosen to provide a web service for the sake of user who wanted to use this product without installing anything !

## I do know that you don't care of everything else, so : Here's the install guide !

What you need absolutely is (the latest) Node.js installed on your system. Don't really care of the OS anyway.
If Node.js is installed then it should work, pretty cool isn't it !

Now, now !!! Once Node.js installed, you should be able to follow this few steps while using NPM (let's me help you destroy the galaxy :D) :

#### Downloads instructions

##### With a command prompt :
    
    "SOMEWHERE> git clone git@github.com:Nymerus/website-application.git"
    OR "SOMEWHERE> git clone https://github.com/Nymerus/website-application.git"
   
##### With a browser : 

    Download ZIP package from the front page of this GitHub and extract it !
    
#### Installations instructions

##### For this part, a command prompt is needed !

    "SOMEWHERE/website-application> git checkout develop (master)" will change you current branch... well it should work on master
    
    "SOMEWHERE/website-application/app_web> npm install (web_dev)" Go into the app_web folder and install all the dependencies with NPM (and say good bye to your free memory)
    
    "SOMEWHERE/website-application/app_web> npm start (web_dev)" Run the web server : ENJOY ! 
    
By the way, SOMEWHERE is just here to remind you that you should find your folder beforehand =)

    Finally, get you current IP (Don't try 192.168.0.1 =_=), then into you browser address bar, enter "IP:8080" with IP is your current IP address.

##### It work well right ! Well I hope so :p
